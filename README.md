# JS-Calculator

Six weeks into DevAcademy, I tried my hand at making a JavaScript scientific calculator, this project was never finished, and I managed to make a mess of my code but it's safe to say since this point I've focused on learning clean, maintainable coding practices. 

This project involved creating a syntax parser, recursive evaluation of brackets inside expressions, managing input validadation, inserting implicit multiplication operators, and many more things.

My skills have improved hugely since here, but it's interesting to look back at.
